         ii) you will be asked to enter the password (enter the same password you are using to access your mac, so you do not
             forget it in future. NOTE: while typing password, it is hidden, you wont see asterisk or anything)
         iii) you will be asked where you want to save the ssh key, just press enter, by default it will save on
              /Users/(your pc name)/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
         iv) you will see the private key being generated, which is not the SSH key.
         
 Step 2: Copying the SSH key and pasting into your Git hub account
         i) In your terminal type: pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
         ii) Once you have typed above command press enter.
